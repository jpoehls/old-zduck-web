**Disclaimer:** I didn't work for this knowledge. Google provided
it for me on a silver platter from the [TFS Forums](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfsversioncontrol/thread/0836d05c-79f6-4fa9-9adf-75248cc314ff).

So you just found out that last week while you were cleaning house in your project's
TFS source control that you deleted something that was still being used.

No problem!

Here's the fast track to recovering those deleted items.

1. In Visual Studio, go to Tools | Options | Source Control | Visual Studio Team Foundation
2. Check the box to "Show deleted items in the Source Control Explorer"

	 <a class="img lightbox" href="/images/posts/tfs_deleted_files_option.png">
	 	<img src="/images/posts/tfs_deleted_files_option.png" width="400" /></a>
	 
3. Open up Source Control Explorer (View | Other Windows | Source Control Explorer)
4. Browse to where the deleted items used to live.

5. You see all those faded folders with x's on them? Those are the now undead
	 folders living among the rest of your source. If you are looking for a specific
	 file instead of a folder, you can see those as well. In the list of tiles they
	 will be grayed out and in the "Latest" column will say "Deleted".
6. After you locate what you want to undelete, right-click on the item and click Undelete.

7. That's it! The resurrection is now part of your pending changes.
   
Note that I wrote these steps for Visual Studio 2008 and TFS 2008 so older and newer versions beware.
