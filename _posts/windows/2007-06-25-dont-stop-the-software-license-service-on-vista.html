Ok. So when <a href="http://automaticchainsaw.blogspot.com/">someone refers to you as a guru</a>, you feel like you have certain expectations you have to meet. I think I just blew that opportunity. ;)

My Vista workstation at home has been running pretty slow lately, so I figured I'd see what services I could disable to maybe speed it up. I fired up Sysinternal's (now Microsoft's) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/Autoruns.mspx">AutoRuns utility</a> and went to work. I disabled several services and applications, one of them being a service called "Software Licensing".

The Software Licensing service is described as the following:
<blockquote>Enables the download, installation and enforcement of digital licenses for Windows and Windows applications. If the service is disabled, the operating system and licensed applications may run in a reduced function mode.</blockquote>

Sounds pretty unnecessary right? Uh, right, that's what I thought... So after I rebooted my system to admire my new speed boost, I'm greeted with an error at logon stating that an Error Occurred while Activating Windows.

Obviously I got into safe mode and re-enabled that service but several things strike me as frustrating here.

1) I activated Windows a long time ago, why does it need a service taking up resources just to confirm that fact?
2) When it says "If the service is disabled the operating system and licensed applications <b><i>may</i></b> run in a reduced function mode." -- No doubt, they <b>WILL</b> function in a reduced function mode...
3) Why did I assume that any services labeled as "Licensing" and published by Microsoft would be okay to stop???
