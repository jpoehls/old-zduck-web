Hello Safari, welcome to the Windows world!

Mac has released a public beta of their [Safari web browser](http://www.apple.com/safari/)
that runs on Windows. What's special?

- It's Mac, so that means it has to be awesome right?
- They say its faster than Firefox.

Well if it is really faster than Firefox they may have me hooked.
So I installed the beta and here are my thoughts.

1. It does seem to be noticably faster loading most websites, AWESOME!
2. I don't see an easy way to search my bookmarks. In Firefox
   I can open a sidebar with my bookmarks, start typing and watch it filter
   through my bookmarks. This is a must have feature for any compulsive bookmarker.
3. When you use the Back button it appears to reload the webpage which
   is much slower than using Firefox's Back button which loads from cache.
4. When you open your bookmarks it takes over the whole browser, this
   isn't so bad, except when you close them it appears to reload the page again. Ugh.
5. I don't see a way to sync my bookmarks between multiple computers.
   This is another must have feature for anyone who does the computer
   shuffle on a regular basis. In Firefox I'm using [Google Sync](http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/) and it works very well.
6. Safari uses it's own text smoothing engine (i.e. not ClearType), this takes some adjusting to.

Hopefully most of these will be ironed out as Safari comes out of beta.
