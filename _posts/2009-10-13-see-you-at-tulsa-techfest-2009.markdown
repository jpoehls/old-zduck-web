For the past couple years I've been able to attend both days of
[Tulsa TechFest](http://techfests.com/Tulsa/2009/default.aspx), a developer
conference here in Oklahoma, and this year I'm going back! Interestingly,
it's only a one day event this time. I hope this isn't a sign of
dwindling support for the event.

Attendance is $2 or 2 cans of food. Right up my alley.

Out of the [full agenda](http://techfests.com/Tulsa/2009/Agenda/default.aspx)
here's what I'm currently planning on attending:

-  9:00a 'ASP.NET 4.0 & Visual Studio 2010' with Robert Boedigheimer
-  10:30a 'Expression Blend 3.0 and Sketchflow' with Michael Benkovich
-  1:00p 'Loosen Your Domain with Message-Driven Architecture' with [Chris Patterson](http://blog.phatboyg.com/)
    
   I really enjoyed the iPhone development session that he hosted an
   at last year's TechFest. Since then I've been loosely following the
   [MassTransit](http://code.google.com/p/masstransit/) project that he
   is partnered on and I am looking forward to seeing him present again this year.
    
-  2:30p 'Logos That Really Work' with JP Jones

-  4:00p 'Leveraging Client Capabilities with jQuery in Visual Studio and ASP.NET' with Robert Boedigheimer

Oh yeah, and I'll be taking advantage of the crowd this year to shamelessly promote my blog.
