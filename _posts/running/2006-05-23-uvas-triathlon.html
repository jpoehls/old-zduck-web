I completed my second triathlon of the season a few days ago and Jessie took some pictures, so I thought I would do a quick post with how I did and a couple photos.<br/>
The first of the season for me (and for a lot of people) was the <a href="http://www.strawberryfieldstri.com/">Strawberry Fields Tri</a> in my hometown of Ventura, CA (actually, Oxnard, but it's basically the same) â€“ I mentioned that one in my last post.  It was basically a duathlon (run and bike), since they cancelled the 400yd swim due to unbelievably strong currents.<br/>
In that race, I finished with the following time table :<br/>

<th>Rank</th>
<th>Pctile</th>
<th>Time</th>
<th>Pace</th>

This past Sunday, I ran in the <a href="http://www.japroductions.com/uvas/index.html"><span class="caps">UVAS</span> Triathlon</a> in Morgan Hill.  It was longer, though still short of Olympic distance â€“ 3/4mi swim, 16mi bike, 5mi run.<br/>

Actually, there was a mile long honkin hill around mile 11 that was just killer.  I saw people walking their bikes up it.<br/>
Here's how I did in Morgan Hill :<br/>
