title: Weekend Run
---
<p class="note_content clearfix">So, as I promised, I did an 18 mile run on Sunday with my new toy. Some cool things I learned about myself and my new toy. One is that when you upload the data, MotionBased gives you a Google Earth file so you can do a flyover of your whole route, which is pretty cool. Here's what my run looked like:

I think that's pretty spiffy. If you click on that image, it should take you to the data page for my run, which has all sorts of cool info, including the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=2255113764&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftrail.motionbased.com%2Ftrail%2Fkml%2Fepisode.kml%3FepisodePkValues%3D2271065&amp;h=cfa2c03bf0605720c5fab86f420c71db" target="_blank" title="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/kml/episode.kml?episodePkValues=2271065">Google Earth file</a>.
I also learned some interesting things about me. It turns out that my heartrate tends to go down during a long run. It started out at about 160 and trended down towards the low 140's by the end. My speed decreased a bit too, but not by too much - my first couple miles were in the 8:30/mi range and then for most of the rest of the run I kept around a 9:30/mi pace:

I also discovered that I burned about 2200 calories in the almost 3 hours it took to run (2:51).  Here are my overall stats:
<ul>
	<li>Total Moving Time: 2:51:33</li>
	<li>Total Distance: 18.11 miles</li>
	<li>Avg Speed: 6.3 mph</li>
	<li>Avg Pace: 9:28 min/mile</li>
	<li>Avg Heart Rate: 149bpm</li>
	<li>Elevation Gain: 960ft</li>
</ul>
At any rate, it's a fun running toy and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes to run.
