This past weekend I <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=2322348764&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftrail.motionbased.com%2Ftrail%2Factivity%2F2320245&amp;h=019c4ab59600d489bfdcc9784effb908" target="_blank" title="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/activity/2320245">ran a 30k</a> (18mi) at Pirates Cove, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=2322348764&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pctrailruns.com%2FPirates_Cove.htm&amp;h=1640d67e8287221afd8305342a6e1e15" target="_blank" title="http://www.pctrailruns.com/Pirates_Cove.htm">Pacific Coast Trail Runs</a>.  Here's the Google Earth image of the running route (taken from my handy dandy Forerunner 305):

Unfortunately, it was really foggy out, so I didn't get to enjoy what I'm sure were normally really spectacular views. However, I did have a good time and had a really good run (probably due to the chilly weather). I finished it in just under 3 hours, which gives me an average pace of 9:47 min/mile over the 18 miles. As you can see from the Google Earth image, it was fairly hilly.<br/>
Jessica was signed up to run the 8k, but accidentally took a wrong turn and ended up doing the 20k instead. â€œAccidental Half Marathonâ€ is a new phrase around the Chacon household.<br/>
Here is an idea of the length of the run in relation to the Bay Area:<br/>
