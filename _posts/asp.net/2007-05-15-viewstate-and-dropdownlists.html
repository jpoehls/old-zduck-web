    Did you know ViewState is the root of all evil?
    Ok, maybe not all evil but certainly 90% of all ASP.NET page bloat.
    This isn't a strike against .NET, just a sign of how powerful it really is.
    Any platform that can enable developers to screw up so easily and never realize
    it <i>has</i> to be very powerful indeed.
    To borrow a quote from another blog I was reading...
</p>

    ASP.NET is so powerful that it can enable you to be an incredibly bad programmer
    FASTER THAN EVER. Don't program by coincidence.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    Yesterday I wanted to disable ViewState on one of my DropDownLists.
    Reason? The drop-down has 3000 items in it.
    Yes, I know, sick and wrong... It's bad enough that the drop-down itself is so large
    but with ViewState, every item in the drop-down essentially gets sent to the client
    <i><b>twice!</i></b> How else do you think ViewState remembers what items were in your drop-down when
    you do a PostBack? It's very handy, but for large lists it can significantly increase
    the size of the page you are sending to the client. Just to give you some idea,
    by disabling ViewState on my drop-down I saved nearly 200 kB. That's significant
    bandwidth savings, especially for those last couple of dial-up users out there.
    <b>Problem</b> Now that ViewState is disabled for
    my drop-down I have a few issues:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>ASP.NET pulls the SelectedValue property of the DropDownList out of ViewState. Guess
        what? No ViewState == no SelectedValue.</li><li>Even though AutoPostBack still works,
            the SelectedIndexChanged event has lost its firing pin.</li><li>My drop-down now loses
                all of its items after I any post-back occurs. Suprise, it also forgets which items
                was selected.</li></ol>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Despite ASP.NET's attempts to deceive you into thinking that everything that matters
        <i>must</i> be a Property of the control (i.e.
        SelectedValue)... ASP.NET is just a fancy wrapper around HTTP and thus any values
        that are set from the client are received by the server via the Request.Form or
        Request.QueryString. Since these are POST-backs, we're interested in Request.Form.
        Now we just need to know that ASP.NET uses the control's UniqueID property to name
        the control on the client, this means that Request.Form[myDropDownCtrl.UniqueID]
        will give me the value of that drop-down list as it was sent from the client. This
        is the exact same as myDropDownCtrl.SelectedValue. Bingo!</li><li>There are ways to
            get the SelectedIndexChanged event to fire again but I found an easier work-around
            for my needs. This also covers #3...</li></ol>
{% highlight csharp %}
protected string MySelectedValue
{
get
{
  return (ViewState["MySelectedValue"] == null) ? null : ViewState["MySelectedValue"].ToString();
}
set
{
  ViewState["MySelectedValue"] = value;
}
}

protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
// Check if the selectedValue has changed.
string selectedValue = Request[myDropDownCtrl.UniqueID];
if (selectedValue != MySelectedValue)
{
  // Value has changed, do whatever you would do in the SelectedIndexChanged event here.
}
MySelectedValue = selectedValue;

// TODO: Populate the drop-down control
PopulateMyDropDownCtrl();

// set the set the selectedValue on the drop-down
if (selectedValue != null)
{
  myDropDownCtrl.Items.FindByValue(selectedValue).Selected = true;
}
}
