title: RailsConf Git Talk
---
<p>I just got back from RailsConf 2008, which was held in Portland again this year, and I have to say I had a really excellent time.  I met tons of really cool people, had a hundred conversations about Git and Ruby and consumed a fair amount of Drop Top.</p><br/>
<p>In addition to that, my talk went as well as I could have hoped.  The place was packed, I talked on the second day after they had extended the rooms and the room was still almost totally full.  The presentation went off without a hitch and dozens of people came up to me through the rest of the weekend to say they enjoyed it, so that made me feel really great.</p><br/>
<p>One of the awesome guys that I met there, Daniel Wanja of <a href="http://onrails.org">OnRails.org</a>, was kind enough to take some video of my talk, if you're curious how I present or how many people there were:</p><br/>

<p>There were about 520 slides that I went through in 55 minutes (went a tad bit over the time limit) and some of them had moving pieces, meaning I probably clicked that clicker at least 600 times during that talk.</p><br/>
<p><b>Update</b>: I've recorded my basic talk over the presentation of the full slide deck and posted it as an episode at <a href="http://gitcasts.com/posts/railsconf-git-talk">GitCasts</a>, if you want to see the whole thing.
</p><br/>
<p>So, now I go back to work, but I enjoyed myself and met a bunch of great people and learned a lot about DataMapper, Erlang (Fuzed and Vertebra), and even a little Ruby... I also got to whine at Chad Fowler about the sessions not being videotaped, which he commiserated with me on.  Lastly, I wanted to point out that for those of you who missed <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/speaker/2909">Nick Kallen's</a> talk on ActiveRecord at the very end of the conference, you missed out on a really well done live coding session - probably the most informative and well presented Ruby learning I've had in months.
