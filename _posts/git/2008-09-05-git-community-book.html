For the past several weeks, I've been working on a free, open source, online book on Git called the <a href="http://book.git-scm.com">Git Community Book</a> that I'm hoping to turn into a great one-stop resource for learning Git.  <br/>
The idea is that we have a super solid Git resource linked right off the Git homepage that people can get most of the answers they need in a single, easy to browse place, from super-beginner to super-advanced.  I've taken some content from the existing User Guide and tutorials that can be found scattered around online, and re-written a lot of it and added a ton of my own content, screencasts and images.  There is a PDF version of the book that is generated and linked automatically everytime I do a build, so for those of you who like a paper or local copy, I've got your back.  Probably 80% of the book is done now, and now I'm looking for some other contributors and some feedback.<br/>
I have a bunch of ideas for <a href="http://git-scm.com">git-scm.com</a> and the <a href="http://book.git-scm.com">Git Community Book</a> - I'd like to do searchable documentation, a cookbook, a quick-start guide and a few more things - but first I want to get this online book at least initially complete.  If you are interested in helping contribute content for a section or chapter, I would hugely appreciate it.  Even if it's just notes that you've tested, I would be happy to humanize it for you.  Or, if you've written a blog post that I can re-use the contents of that cover one of the topics, that would also be great.<br/>
The topics I'm currently looking for are Advanced History Modification, Corruption Recovery, Branch Tracking, Subversion Integration, Git with Perl/Python/PHP, and Git with Editors (especially NetBeans/Eclipse).  I can write them, but since I have limited personal experience with these topics, I'm not very confident that they would turn out particularly well.<br/>
Again, the book itself is open sourced and you can download the raw markdown and build scripts from it's <a href="http://github.com/schacon/gitscm/tree/book">GitHub repo</a>, and read the "how to contribute" guide on <a href="http://github.com/schacon/gitscm/wikis/how-to-contribute">it's wiki</a>.<br/>
Write me if you can help contribute or proof-read the existing content at <a href="mailto:schacon@gmail.com">schacon at gmail.com</a>.<br/>
Thanks, and I hope you like the book!
