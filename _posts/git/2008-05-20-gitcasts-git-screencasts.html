title: GitCasts - Git Screencasts
---
Continuing on my git-ish roll, I've just launched a new site called <a href="http://www.gitcasts.com">GitCasts</a>.  I've noticed that a lot of people have been watching my <a href="http://jointheconversation.org/railsgit">other screencast</a>, nearly 5,500 views so far - so I thought I would do something along the lines of the excellent <a href="http://railscasts.com">RailsCasts</a> website and do a bunch of short, topical screencasts on Git usage and internals. <br/>
I've put the site live with the first 4 screencasts:<br/>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gitcasts.com/posts/setup-initialization-and-cloning">Setup, Initialization and Cloning</a>
<li><a href="http://www.gitcasts.com/posts/normal-workflow">Normal Workflow</a>
<li><a href="http://www.gitcasts.com/posts/interactive-adding">Interactive Adding</a>
<li>and <a href="http://www.gitcasts.com/posts/git-log">Git Log</a>
</ul><br/>
Those of you who have my <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/git-internals-pdf">Peepcode Git Book</a> may notice that these are the same screencasts that are distributed with the book.  Next up will be "Browsing Git Objects", "Branching and Merging", "Rebasing" and "Distributed Workflow".  After that, I will continue to produce short screencasts, mainly from the list I'm keeping <a href="http://www.gitcasts.com/episodes">here</a>, so if there is something you want to see, give me a <a href="mailto:schacon@gmail.com">shout</a>.<br/>
Hope you find it helpful.
