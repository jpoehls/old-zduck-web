title: Git and Rails News
---
It looks like yesterday my Git/Rails screencast got on the new <a href="http://reddit.com/r/ruby/">ruby reddit</a> page, which I deduced because Peter Cooper (I'm assuming of RubyInside fame) left a comment on the page all of a sudden.  So I looked at my Google Analytics page and my hits went from about 30 a day to 500 yesterday, which is a fun little curve.  So, welcome all, I hope you enjoy the screencast.<br/>
In other news, I have been informed that my presentation proposal for RailsConf 2008 has been accepted, so I will be speaking on <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/detail/963">"Using Git to Manage and Deploy Your Rails Apps"</a> in Portland in May.  I hope to see you all there.  I promise the talk will be more energetic than my little screencast.<br/>
Also, the <a href="http://errfree.com/">ErrFree</a> guys have just opened up beta for <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, which I have now moved the repo for <a href="/rubygit">Ruby/Git</a> to.  I'll update the Ruby/Git page soon.
