<p>Two things from <a href="http://www.advocatesforrasiej.com">Advocates for Rasiej</a> today that I wanted to share.  I have been continually going back to this because his election is in a few months, and is by far the most similar in tactics and certainly in spirit to mine that I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p><br/>

	<p>He just posted the text of a <a href="http://www.advocatesforrasiej.com/2005/05/16/my-remarks-at-pdf-this-morning/">speech</a> on his website that he delivered to us at the opening of the <span class="caps">PDF</span> conference that I could have written (if, of course, I were a more talented writer).</p><br/>

(emphasis added by me)
<blockquote>
We see how politics, instead of being a dirty word, could be what it meant in the original Greek: <b>the engagement of all citizens in the decisions that affect their lives</b>.<br/>
	<p>...</p><br/>

	<p>We techno-politicos should instead be focusing on how we can restore health to our civic life Ã¢â‚¬â€ and in particular, how we can get more people connected to each other and their government to <b>raise issues, share ideas and solve problems</b>.</p><br/>

	<p>After all, there are lots of good reasons that most Americans hate politics. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been taken away from them and turned into a cynical game that is more focused on winning elections than getting things done, <b>where tearing the other side down matters more than lifting ideas up</b>, where people are treated as commodities, and the only ones who get any attention are the people who can pay to play.</p><br/>

	<p>...</p><br/>

	<p>We need to aggressively advocate new ways to use technology to foster a more <b>open, responsive, and accountable government</b>.</p><br/>

</blockquote><br/>
	<p>I used to have &#8220;government that is open, efficient and empowering&#8221; on my front page.  Now it&#8217;s openness, community, conversation &#8211; but you can see why I liked this speech.  It goes on, and the whole thing is both well written and exciting in what it means to us.  If this is the future of politics, as I am also working to make it, then we are looking at a better future for politics.</p><br/>

	<p>Also from the Rasiej front, I got an email from him today (mass mail), an update on his campaign.  As you may remember, he is also running a $100 campaign.  Here is what the email said :</p><br/>

<blockquote>
Something&#8217;s happening here.<br/>
	<p>In just <b>two weeks</b>, our campaign to reconnect New York signed up <b>818 supporters and raised $72,000</b>. With no contributions over $100. No fundraisers. Just a powerful message about reimagining our possibilities and recharging our democracy.</p><br/>

	<p>This is unprecedented in New York politics.</p><br/>

	<p>That&#8217;s because it shows that you don&#8217;t have to chase big checks to run a successful campaign. It also shows that there are a lot of people like you who are hungry for new leadership.</p><br/>

	<p>...</p><br/>

	<p>In the coming days I will be launching a new feature on my website&#8212;<span class="caps">IDEAS4NYC</span>. Each week we will post a question on a different issue, and ask you to give us your specific solutions. We&#8217;ll share the results on our blog. And we&#8217;ll take the best ideas and add them to the policy agenda we are developing.</p><br/>

Together we are going to prove that people matter more than money and ideas matter more than influence.
</blockquote><br/>
	<p>So there you go &#8211; both a good idea (somewhat in the spirit of my <a href="http://www.chaconforcongress.com/modules/wiwimod/">Collaborative Bill Writer</a>, but more structured), and also another example of a $100 campaign working.</p><br/>

	<p>Not enough time for a podcast today, perhaps tomorrow.  Have a good day everyone!</p><br/>
