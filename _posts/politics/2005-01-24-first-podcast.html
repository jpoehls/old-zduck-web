title: First Podcast!

<p>I have released my first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">Podcast</a>!.  This post has an enclosure in the <a href="http://www.chaconforcongress.com/modules/wordpress/wp-rss2.php"><span class="caps">RSS2</span> feed</a> that links to the mp3 of my very first podcast.</p><br/>

	<p>What is podcasting, you may ask?</p><br/>

<blockquote>Podcasting involves the recording of internet radio or similar internet audio programs. These recordings are then made available for download to portable digital audio device. You can then listen to the podcast internet radio program while you are away from your computer or at a different time than the original program was broadcast.</blockquote><br/>

	<p>Being my first show of hopefully many, it is obviously not perfect.  If some of the sound is off, or bad quality, or I make any factual mistakes, please <a href="mailto:scott@jointheconversation.org">contact me</a>, so I can fix it next time.  Let me know what you think!</p><br/>

	<p>Huge thanks to
