<p>We are going to be walking soon, hopefully this week if we get the materials done in time, and I don&#8217;t want to waste any chances, so I set up a Community Captains volunteering site to record people who are interested in the program here : <a href="http://www.communitycaptains.com">www.CommunityCaptains.com</a>.</p><br/>

	<p>In order to recruit people who might be interested when we are out walking, I&#8217;ve created this flyer to hand out to people who sound interested.  I wanted to post it here to let everyone take a look at it and tell me what you think.</p><br/>

	<p>I realize that of the people in the graphic, none of them seem to be women &#8211; that is not intentional, it was just the best art I could find in my price range.  I&#8217;ll try to replace it at some point if I can find better art with women in it.</p><br/>

	<p>Other than that, is there anything you notice that could use improvement &#8211; would it make you interested in volunteering?</p><br/>

	<p>Let me know what you think.</p><br/>
