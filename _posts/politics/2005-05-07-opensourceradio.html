<p>I was contacted yesterday on <span class="caps">AOL</span> Instant Messenger (my username is &#8216;<a href="aim:GoIm?screenname=repchacon">repchacon</a>&#8217;, by the way), by a guy named <a href="http://www.prx.org/user/brendangreeley">Brendan Greeley</a>, who is apparently a site editor for <a href="http://www.prx.org"><span class="caps">PRX</span></a>, which I&#8217;ve mentioned here <a href="http://www.chaconforcongress.com/modules/wordpress/index.php/archives/2005/03/04/friday-podcast/">before</a> (although I&#8217;m pretty sure he didn&#8217;t know that).</p><br/>

	<p>Anyhow, it turns out that Brendan is working on a new <span class="caps">WGBH</span> produced, <a href="http://www.pri.org/PublicSite/home.html">Public Radio International</a> syndicated radio show called <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/">Radio Open Source</a> that is recording pilots right now. In fact, they just released their very first one today.</p><br/>

	<p>From the <a href="http://blog.opensourcemedia.net/?p=2">Starting Points</a> page&#8230;</p><br/>

	<p>This project is fascinating to me, and I will follow it closely.  The reason that Brendan contacted me is because he was interested in what I was doing with podcasting in my campaign for the first show, although it looks like they are thinking of possibly including me in a different show later on instead.</p><br/>

	<p>So, something interesting to keep your eye on.  If you want, you can subscribe to their <a href="http://www.radioopensource.org/feed/">feed</a>.</p><br/>
