title: GIS Instead of Podcast
---
<p>I put off the podcast for today, because I was working on some <span class="caps">GIS</span> stuff and I actually got a break.  <span class="caps">GIS</span> stands for Geographic Information Systems &#8211; it is technology used to make maps, and it will be very important to this campaign.  Normally custom <span class="caps">GIS</span> is not used in Congressional races unless the candidate is willing to spend several thousand dollars on the software and experts needed to use it.  The easiest software I have seen is <a href="http://www.caliper.com/maptovu.htm">Maptitude</a>  by Caliper, which sells for only $500.  <span class="caps">ESRI</span> sells it&#8217;s popular and powerful <a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcview/">ArcView</a> software which is used pretty often for this, but it is more like $1500 for the software alone &#8211; hiring someone that can use it is something else entirely.</p><br/>

	<p>I want to run this on Mac and/or Linux with some custom database and automated scripting, so I&#8217;m using <a href="http://grass.itc.it/"><span class="caps">GRASS</span></a>, which is both open and free.</p><br/>

However, it is a bit of a learning curve, especially when you don&#8217;t know much about <span class="caps">GIS</span> to begin with.  However, I made a breakthrough this morning, learning how to import and view both <a href="http://swdb.berkeley.edu/data/d00/g04_geo_conv.html">Shapefiles</a> and <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/"><span class="caps">TIGER</span>/Line</a> data.   Which means I can map and overlay the congressional districts, voting precincts from 2004, county and full street and landmark information for all 4 counties in my district.  Here are some quick maps :

(full street maps of all four counties; 
blue is district lines, light grey is 04 voting precincts, black are streets)<br/>

(04 precincts on top of districts by color &#8211; green is mine)
</center>
It&#8217;s not very useful by itself, but I can zoom down to any precinct and see the street layout, and I will be able to start marking houses I have visited, voter ID results, printing custom walking maps for volunteers over the web, etc.</p><br/>

	<p>It will be invaluable for door to door planning and precinct captain organizing, as well as data and progress visualization.</p><br/>

	<p>So, no podcast &#8211; technology called!</p>
