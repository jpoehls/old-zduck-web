title: MicroGoal #2 Complete
---
<p>Our second Micro-Goal was completed tonight, the last donation was contributed by Matt So &#8211; thank you Matt!  This Micro-Goal was to print materials and voter lists for our first county for walking, and we are in the process of getting quotes right now.  As soon as I get my <span class="caps">FEC</span> number, the voter data will be purchased as well.</p><br/>

	<p>When we have started the walking, I&#8217;ll publish the second report for everyone who contributed and all of our supporters.</p><br/>

	<p>I have posted our next Micro-Goal, which is for printed materials for our Dublin precinct walking.  Thank you everyone who contributed, and if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, please take a look at the example Micro-Goal Report linked in the last post.</p>
