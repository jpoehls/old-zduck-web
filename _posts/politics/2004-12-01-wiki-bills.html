<p>The Wikimedia group is doing some great things with collaborative work.  I have been a fan of <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, their online encyclopedia for some time now, and have recently found new projects they are working on.  Among them a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page">dictionary</a>, a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">media repository</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikisource:Main_Page">source documents</a> site, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/q:Main_Page">quotations</a> site, and now a <a href="http://demo.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page">news site</a>.  They are written by the community, and are extensive and multilingual.</p><br/>

	<p>By the way, a &#8220;Wiki&#8221; is a group of linked pages online, each of which can be edited by anyone. It is used to create documents openly, in large groups.</p><br/>

	<p>In this spirit, I have just put up a Wiki page here on this site for collaboration in this community.  It can be a place to build documents and projects together, and the first thing I have put up is a Bill Creator.  I encourage everyone to think of a bill you would like to see passed, and sketch it out in our Wiki.  We can fill them in together, as a group.  There is no reason I can see for special interests to have all the fun.</p>
