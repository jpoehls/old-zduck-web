<p>Sorry that everything has just been podcasts lately, I&#8217;m just trying to get in the groove here.  It&#8217;s a little more difficult than you might think to produce these.  I will try to start blogging a little more.</p><br/>

	<p>I hope you enjoy this show, I cover the Fed, Jogging for Congress, and an <span class="caps">AIDS</span> vaccine.  Enjoy your Tuesday!</p><br/>
