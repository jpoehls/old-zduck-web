	<p>Howdy everybody.  Jessica and I spent our Easter weekend in Yosemite National Park, just a few hours east of here.  We hiked to the top of Yosemite falls, took some pictures with Jessie&#8217;s medium format camera, and came back down.</p><br/>

	<p>It was a great weekend, and now that we&#8217;re back and I&#8217;m just getting around to putting the pictures from that up, we&#8217;re off to <a href="http://www.wellstone.org/camp/events_detail.aspx?itemID=5161&#38;catID=3752">Camp Wellstone</a> at <span class="caps">USC</span> for the remainder of the week and next weekend.  So, no podcasts this week, but I&#8217;ll have some whoppers next week with news and events and goings on.</p><br/>

	<p>For now, here are a few pictures from the hike, and I&#8217;ll try to get the medium format shots up when we get them back.</p><br/>
