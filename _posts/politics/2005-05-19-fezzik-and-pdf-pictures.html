title: Fezzik and PDF Pictures
---
<p>I uploaded some of my pictures from the <span class="caps">PDF</span> conference, and added them into the previous posts.  Since this trip was originally a micro-goal, I&#8217;m going to produce a microgoal report about it as a final wrap-up, and as an example of what the reports will look like.  Look for that later.  For now, I will leave you with my good friend, Fezzik.</p><br/>
