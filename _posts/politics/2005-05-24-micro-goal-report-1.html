title: Micro Goal Report #1
---
<p>In order to create an example of a Micro-Goal report, I have created one out of what was a Goal for a short time, but was then changed.  This is not a real Goal report, in that no actual campaign funds were spent on the Personal Democracy Forum trip, but I created a report from the trip nonetheless.</p><br/>

	<p>I am just shy of completing my second Micro-Goal, so when the work on that is done, I will submit to you all my next report, but in the meantime take a look at this example and let me know what you think should be added or subtracted.  Imagine that you contributed money to a goal, what would you want to know about how it was spent or used?  Any ideas are welcome.</p><br/>

	<p>Thanks!
