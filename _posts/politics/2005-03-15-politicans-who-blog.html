title: Politicans who blog
---
<p>The Personal Democracy Forum <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com/blog">blog</a>, which is associated to the conference I have been talking about that is happening in May, has posted a few entries discussing politicians who blog.  I commented on one of the threads, and now my name was mentioned in the most recent post.</p><br/>

From the entry : 
<blockquote>
Molly Chapman Norton&#8217;s recent article about Members of Congress and blogging has an interesting <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com/node/403#comment">thread</a> going, including Molly&#8217;s discovery of a list maintained by the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/programs/lis/NALIT/blogs.htm">National Conference of State Legislators</a> of state reps who blog, and word from one 2006 congressional candidate, <a href="http://www.chaconforcongress.com/modules/wordpress/">Scott Chacon,</a> who is blogging, podcasting many of his posts, and running with a voluntary limit of $100 a contributor (could Joe Trippi be advising him?).
</blockquote><br/>
	<p>I would highly recommend this site &#8211; the features and blog sections are both excellent, and I am really looking forward to the conference.  I should probably sign up soon.  Stupid money.</p><br/>

	<p><a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com/user/120">Jon Garfunkel</a> then comments on me : 
<blockquote>
Well, as you noted, the $100 challenge is nothing new. But an 18-month, online-brewed campaign for Congress, that could be the start of a trend.</p><br/>

I have trouble finding out much about Scott on his site though&#8230; that picture on the right is not of him.
</blockquote><br/>
	<p>For one, I just put up some more content, including a page about me.  Second, let&#8217;s hope a trend starts.</p><br/>

	<p>By the way, Trippi is not advising me, but that is where I got the idea.</p>
