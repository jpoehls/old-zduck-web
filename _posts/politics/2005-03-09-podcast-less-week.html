title: Podcast-less Week
---
<p>As you can see, I did not do a podcast yesterday, and I will not do one tomorrow.  I have been busy in the mornings trying to get some content finished for the website.  I have also begun planning out the framework for what will be the final website.  I will continue my podcasts next week, and hopefully have some extra content up as well.</p><br/>

	<p>The final framework, when I get started on it, will be open source, so anyone that is interested is invited to join the project.  It will be somewhat <a href="http://www.civicspacelabs.org">Civic Space</a> like, but more focused on only what a candidate would need and hopefully a bit more elegant.  I will let everyone know more as I get farther into it.</p>
