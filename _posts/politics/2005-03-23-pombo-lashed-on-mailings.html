<p>From a recent article in the Sacramento Bee entitled <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/story/12575851p-13430602c.html">Pombo lashed on mailings</a> :</p><br/>

<blockquote>
Rep. Richard Pombo, the Tracy Republican who heads the House Resources Committee, was taken to task Wednesday for sending out committee mailings last fall that critics contend were intended to influence the presidential elections in a key battleground state.<br/>
The charges came during a House Administration Committee hearing on the 2005-06 budget Pombo submitted for his committee, including another $100,000 for mass mailings over the next two years.
