title: Walking Flyers
---
<p>Here are the general flyers that I will be passing out as a leave behind when we walk. I&#8217;ll order 1000 of them for hand delivering in our precincts.  I tried to get most of the ideas and feel of the campaign into it &#8211; let me know what you think and if you have any improvements for the next run.</p><br/>

	<p>I did reuse that stupid womanless graphic again, but I like the feel of it, and this flyer had to be one-color for cost reasons.  Later in the campaign, I may do full color flyers, but they are far more expensive.</p><br/>

	<p>Feedback, my friends &#8211; what do you think?</p><br/>
