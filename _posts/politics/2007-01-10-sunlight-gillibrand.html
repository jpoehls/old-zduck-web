<p class="note_content clearfix">How amazing is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=2255083764&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgillibrand.house.gov%2Fsunlight.shtml&amp;h=fa74ac068dcdc7a80e4f93a0e00b0cdf" target="_blank" title="http://gillibrand.house.gov/sunlight.shtml">this</a>? It may not look like much at first sight, but this is the first step towards a far more open and accountable government. That link is to the Sunlight Report of Representative Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, stating what she did on Jan 9th.
<blockquote>
*  Floor Votes on 9/11 Commission recommendations (H.R. 1) (See Congressional Record).
* Steering Committee meeting where Rep. Gillibrand won an appointment to the Agriculture Committee.
* House Armed Services Committee meeting to discuss Secretary of Defense Robert Gates committee appearance later this week.
* Blue Dog Caucus meeting to discuss organizational issues for the 110th Congress.
* Attended a reception held by Women's Policy INC. to welcome the new Members of Congress and discuss women's issues.</blockquote>
I tried to get Jerry McNerney to do this, but they weren't interested, unfortunately. I hope this gets fleshed out more and hopefully adopted by more Congresspeople.
