<p>This was recorded Monday morning, but I think the sound levels are a bit low, and the website was down all morning, so I wasn&#8217;t able to get the file uploaded.  On this show we discuss <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, Working to Contract, Democracy in the Middle East, and several campaign ideas.</p><br/>

	<p>Here it is, Podcast Number 14.</p><br/>
