<p>First of all, I apologize for the poor sound quality of this podcast &#8211; I had a small problem with the last one in that it was too quiet, so on this one I used a different program to move the sound from the mic to the recorder and the mic volume is too loud, so now it distorts at times.  I also had a &#8220;The Least You Need to Know in the World&#8221; spot that I had to delete entirely from it because I played background music that was louder than my voice for the entire piece, and it was horrible.  So, that being said, here you go.  I&#8217;ll do better next time.</p><br/>
