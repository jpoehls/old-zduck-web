title: Walking and Running
---
<p>Good morning, everyone.  I wanted to take a few minutes to let you know that Jessica and I went door to door this last weekend.  We didn&#8217;t finish the precinct, and we only went out on Sunday, but it is a definite start and I learned a lot.</p><br/>

	<p>We passed out bundles of the flyer I posted earlier and the business card I posted even earlier than that, along with little black and white half sheets of ways to volunteer.  We had a number of good conversations and people were incredibly nice.  I was actually a little surprised &#8211; from my previous walking experiences, it makes a big difference when the actual candidate is at someone&#8217;s house, rather than someone who is volunteering for them.</p><br/>

	<p>I was also surprised at how many people gave us mean looks until we proved that we were not trying to sell them anything and were not from a church.  The first line was met mostly with scowls and then when I said &#8220;and I am running for Congress&#8221;, smiles emerged.  It was actually very encouraging.  I am also hoping I got at least one podcast interview out of it, but I&#8217;ll let you know how that shapes up.</p><br/>

	<p>In total, it was a great experience, and encouraging in that I had a good time, which lets me know that the next year of doing this is going to be an incredible adventure.  We did forget to bring the camera this weekend, so I&#8217;ll try to get some snapshots next weekend, when we finish up that precinct.</p><br/>

	<p>Thanks!
Scott</p>
