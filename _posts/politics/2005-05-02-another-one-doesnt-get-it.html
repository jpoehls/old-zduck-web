title: Another one doesn't get it
---
<p>Steve Westly, who might be <a href="http://www.westly2006.com">running</a> for governor of California, has attempted to understand <a href="http://www.westly2006.com/blog/Default.aspx?id=82">Podcasting</a>.    While I think it&#8217;s great that more politicans are trying to get involved in these types of outreach, there is definitely a line drawn between those who get it and those who don&#8217;t. This is how to identify someone who doesn&#8217;t get it :</p><br/>

(from the website:)
<blockquote>What is a PodCast?
If you have an <span class="caps">MP3</span> player, you can download the file, add it to your music library,  sync it up, and listen to it on your iPod or any other <span class="caps">MP3</span> player.<br/>
Step 1:  Click here
Step 2:  When prompted, save file to disk
Step 3:  Save to your music folder where you keep your MP3s
Step 4:  Add it to your music programs library
Step 5:  Sync it to your iPod (or <span class="caps">MP3</span> player)
</blockquote><br/>
	<p>First of all, the file was corrupted when I downloaded it, so I don&#8217;t know whats going on there.  Second, there is no feed, which means you can&#8217;t subscribe.  I don&#8217;t think you should be defining what &#8220;Podcasting&#8221; is on your website if you don&#8217;t really know.  I am not going to go to this guys site every day to see if there is a new show I can listen to.</p><br/>

	<p>I point this out because this is what I was expecting from politicans &#8211; perhaps not so soon, I&#8217;m excited that people are catching on so early and quickly, but when it did start happening, this is how I expected it.  Not quite full comprehension of why the medium is so powerful, but a half hearted attempt to tell people you&#8217;re going after the youth or tech vote &#8211; posting mp3 files of stump speeches every few months.</p><br/>

	<p>I wanted to contrast this to what <a href="http://oneamericacommittee.com/">John Edwards</a> is doing over at his One America Committee website.  He and Elizabeth (and I think this is mostly Elizabeths doing) have done a couple of podcasts in exactly the format I would like to see from more politicans.  There is a feed to subscribe to, it is fun and informal with a feedback mechanism.  I think it really helps you connect with them, and I hope people like my podcasts as much as I like theirs.  They get it.</p><br/>

	<p>I also have some news about the <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com">Personal Democracy Forum</a>, but I think I&#8217;ll post about that tomorrow.</p>
