<p>So, now that I&#8217;m going to the <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com">Personal Democracy Forum</a>, I went ahead and bought my airplane ticket today for $380. Ouch.</p><br/>

	<p>Here&#8217;s my <a href="/uploads/flight1.gif">itinerary</a>.</p><br/>

	<p>If anyone knows a good way to get from <span class="caps">JFK</span> to 365 Fifth Avenue at 34th street easily and cheaply, please let me know.  I was thinking <a href="http://www.airtrainjfk.com/airtrain/">AirTrain <span class="caps">JFK</span></a>, but what do I know?  If anyone has a better idea, send it on.  I have from 6:18am to 9:00am to get there from the plane landing.</p><br/>

	<p>In case you&#8217;re curious, here is what I&#8217;ll be <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com/conference_program">doing there</a>.</p><br/>

	<p>Alrighty, I&#8217;m off to bed.  Goodnight, everyone.</p>
