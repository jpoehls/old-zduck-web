title: Happy New Year
---
<p>Hello all, I hope everyone had a happy holiday season.  Jessica and I got to spend a lot of time with our families, and even spend a couple of days in and around Yosemite.  I made it onto the internet once in the last two weeks, so the blog postings have been sparse.  OK, nonexistent.  I was saddened to hear of the tsunami, and the continuing aftermath.  If you can, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/tsunami_relief.html">this site</a> that Google set up, with some good links to places you can donate and places you can find ongoing information.</p><br/>

	<p>I have been planning the site redesign and the issues area, and working on the first two issues that will go up, election reform and education.  Let me know if you have any good resources you would like me to check out on either topic.  There will be room to comment on the issues pages themselves, but if you know of anything that is really excellent, please send me an email.</p><br/>

	<p>Thank you, and I hope you all had a happy holiday and a hangover free new year.</p><br/>

	<p>Scott</p>
