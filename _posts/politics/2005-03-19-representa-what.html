<p>I just saw this again, and wanted to point it out.  This is on the Vote Smart page for our current representative, <a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/npat.php?can_id=H0275103">Richard Pombo</a> :</p><br/>

<blockquote>
<span class="caps">REPRESENTATIVE RICHARD W</span>. POMBO <span class="caps">REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO PROVIDE ANY RESPONSES TO CITIZENS ON ISSUES THROUGH THE 2004 NATIONAL POLITICAL AWARENESS TEST</span><br/>
	<p><span class="caps">REPRESENTATIVE RICHARD W</span>. POMBO <span class="caps">REFUSED TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WHEN ASKED TO DO SO BY</span>:</p><br/>

	<p>Major News Organizations</p><br/>

	<p>and key national leaders of both parties including,</p><br/>

John McCain, Republican Senator
Geraldine Ferraro, Former Democratic Congresswoman
Michael Dukakis, Former Democratic Governor
Bill Frenzel, Former Republican Congressman
Richard Kimball, Project Vote Smart President

	<p>I think you should know how your representative stands on the issues.  The <a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/pdf/npat2004/c-npat2004.pdf">National Political Awareness Test</a> (NPAT) was taken by hundreds of other candidates and representatives, and I will put up my responses to the questions in it here on my site in the next few months.</p><br/>

	<p>John McCain doesn&#8217;t even have to ask.</p>
