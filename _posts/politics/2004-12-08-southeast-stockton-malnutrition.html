title: Southeast Stockton Malnutrition
---
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/rundowns/segment.php?wfId=4203415">This story</a> just aired on <a href="http://www.npr.org/atc/"><span class="caps">NPR</span></a>.  This area may or may not be in my district, as the boundry lines cut out quite a bit of the heart of Stockton, but the story is interesting nonetheless.</p><br/>

From the summary : 
<blockquote>Stockton is just a short drive from some of California&#8217;s richest farmland. Yet in economically distressed southeast Stockton, it&#8217;s difficult to find fresh fruits and vegetables. Markets mainly sell high-salt, high-sugar foods and alcohol. </blockquote><br/>
	<p>&lt;!<del>-more</del>-&gt;</p><br/>

	<p>The story is about how type 2 diabetes cases are exploding in the black community of southeast Stockton because local markets don&#8217;t sell fresh fruits and vegetables.  This is particularly disturbing because of the location of Stockton &#8211; right in the middle of the San Joaquin valley. The availability of fresh , healthy food should not be a problem in California&#8217;s farming heartland.</p><br/>

	<p>Near the middle of the piece, they mention farms plowing under their crops that ripen late.  There must be some volunteer gleaning crews in the area &#8211; let me know if you work with one, or know of one in the area.</p><br/>

	<p>If anyone lives in this community, or lives near here, and would like to show me this personally, please contact me.  I would like to hear your story.</p>
