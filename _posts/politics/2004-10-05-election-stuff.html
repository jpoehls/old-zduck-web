<p>So unfortunately, its been quite a while since I posted here, even though I&#8217;ve been so incredibly busy.  I started volunteering for a local congressional campaign, <a href="http://www.jerrymcnerney.com">Jerry McNerney</a>.  I got really involved, walked precincts every weekend for the last three weekends and set up this great website for him.  I had a blog and a forum that was starting to take off, a newspaper writing tool, all sorts of fun stuff.  It turns out that some people are still not ready for the internet to have a place in politics.  His campaign manager thought it was not a good idea to let people write whatever they wanted on the site &#8211; open dialogue is apparently dangerous.  I know that someday soon the internet will be the future of politics, I&#8217;m just trying to figure out how to help it along.  I will probably be posting quite a lot on this topic in the near future.</p>
