I am continually being impressed by Mark Warner's rumblings over at ForwardTogetherPAC.com.<br/>
I just found their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/govmarkwarner/">Flickr feed</a> today.<br/>
The pictures are a little bit more candid than what I would have expected â€“ it's reminding me a bit of some of the forward thinking and really embracing the first pieces of an Open Source Politics that I can't wait to see when the presidential stuff starts.<br/>
I got a bulk email from them the other day that was short and to the point, letting me know about the new podcast they were launching.  It was only a few paragraphs long and the last one was this:
<blockquote> This is just the beginning of the conversation. In future shows Governor Warner will be responding to questions from pod people like you. On our podcast page there's a form for you to submit questions and comments to Mark Warner. Every month the Governor will respond to the most interesting submissions as determined in a very subjective manner by flunkies on his staff. Ask Governor Warner: http://www.forwardtogetherpac.com/pages/podcast</blockquote>
I just like â€œa very subjective manner by flunkies on his staffâ€ â€“ it says to me that they're not posturing and it makes me think he's a little less calculating and a little more trustworthy.<br/>
I'll keep an eye on them for you.
