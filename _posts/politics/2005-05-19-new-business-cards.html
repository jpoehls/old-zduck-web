title: New Business Cards
---
<p>I almost forgot &#8211; I am getting some business cards printed up for the precinct walking that will begin in the next week or so, and I wanted to pass the design by everyone.  I&#8217;ll print up a limited amount for the first round, but if there are any design ideas, or ideas for other useful information to add, or possibly something that is confusing or inaccurate, please let me know in the comments.</p><br/>

	<p>Here you go :</p><br/>
