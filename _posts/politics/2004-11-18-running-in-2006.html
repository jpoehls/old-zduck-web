title: Running in 2006
---
<p>After thinking about it and talking it over with my wife and my friends, I have decided to run for California&#8217;s 11th Congressional District seat in 2006.  I think that the internet can be a great democratizing force, and I want to see what will happen if a candidate fully embraces it as a campaign medium. I will blog personally, not through a staffer.  What you read here will be my thoughts, my voice, not press releases.  The forum will be open to all, and I will be the most frequent user.  A campaign directed by the voters is a campaign committed to communication and one that values the people in its district &#8211; I intend to run such a campaign.</p><br/>

	<p>It may work incredibly well, it may not, but we will work together to keep the discussion honest, open, and focused on values and issues that matter to everyone.  I have been brainstorming how to build a campaign that is inclusive and engaging.  I am starting by limiting all campaign contributions to $100 per individual.  In addition, I am putting up a campaign schedule that is open to the public, where anyone can schedule my time wherever they would like me to be.  So I ask you &#8211; what else can I do?  What do you wish your representative would do?</p><br/>

	<p>I am moving my blog to this site, and I will keep everyone updated on the race as time goes by, as well as actively soliciting your feedback.  I have been taking notes on ideas I have, and I will post them as they start to be fleshed out.  Lets stop complaining and figure out how to do this together.
