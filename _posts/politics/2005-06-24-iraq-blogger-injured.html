title: Iraq Blogger Injured
---
<p>Ever since Kris at <a href="http://alexandertheaverage.blogspot.com/">Alexander the Average</a> recommended to me the <a href="http://www.mudvillegazette.com/archives/000359.html">MilBlogs</a> ring, I have been following a few dozen military blogs on a daily basis.</p><br/>

	<p>Iraq soldiers blogging about their experiences has fascinated me.  So many soldiers in the front lines are keeping regular blogs for thier friends and family to read, it is as if we can listen in on all of these soldiers. My wife being a history student, we own books that consist almost entirely of letters home from previous wars, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743410068/qid=1119564394/sr=8-7/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i7_xgl14/002-9541550-6413667?v=glance&#38;s=books&#38;n=507846">War Letters</a> by Andrew Carroll, and others.  Today we can get these letters home as they happen, not 20 years later &#8211; it can help us get an entirely new perspective on military life and war from the soldiers point of view, in real time &#8211; faster than it would even take a letter to be shipped home.</p><br/>

	<p>Anyhow, I bring this up since one of the blogging soldiers I had read was wounded this week. Army Captain Chuck Ziegenfuss of <a href="http://tcoverride.blogspot.com/">TC Override</a> was injured by shrapnel in the arm and leg by an <span class="caps">IED</span> a few days ago.  His wife has been posting to his website with updates on his condition.</p><br/>

	<p>My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, his children and himself.  I wish him a speedy recovery, and I thank him for his service.</p>
