title: Machado and Matthews Out
---
<p>We got a mention in the Tracy Press today, in an article titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.tracypress.com/local/2005-06-22-machado.html">Pombo wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t face Machado or Matthews</a>&#8221;.  For the last few months, people have been speculating that either <a href="http://democrats.sen.ca.gov/templates/SDCTemplate.asp?cp=MemberPage&#38;pg=senhome&#38;sln=Machado&#38;sdn=05&#38;zrn=Zone/">Mike Machado</a>, a State Senator from Linden, or Assemblywoman <a href="http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a17/">Barbara Matthews</a> would run in the Democratic primary for Congress here (against me).  It now looks as though neither will.  Apparently, I&#8217;m too intimidating.  It&#8217;s understandable.</p><br/>

From the article :
<blockquote cite="http://www.tracypress.com/local/2005-06-22-machado.html">
Another announced Democratic candidate is Dublin computer engineer Scott Chacon. Chacon is similar to many of newer district residents, because he commutes two hours a day.<br/>
	<p>Chacon said he plans to limit contributions to $100 and overcome his lack of name recognition by developing an Internet-based campaign.</p><br/>

Ã¢â‚¬Å“I believe that PomboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abuse of power and ethics problems are becoming far more widely known in our district,Ã¢â‚¬? Chacon said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“PomboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions have given us an opportunity.Ã¢â‚¬?

	<p>In other news, Jessica and I are going river rafting on the American River this weekend, so we won&#8217;t be walking or otherwise much working on the campaign, but we will be back next week, and I&#8217;ll try to get some good pictures &#8211; I hear it&#8217;s very pretty up there.</p><br/>

	<p>As far as the campaign itself goes, I&#8217;m working on reworking and otherwise finishing up our full &#8220;Plan to Win&#8221; document, and fleshing out an idea for helping out with the horrible traffic problems so many of us face out here.  I&#8217;ll get both of them up on the site as soon as they&#8217;re ready.</p><br/>

	<p>Much more on the way &#8211; we&#8217;re just really getting started now.</p><br/>
