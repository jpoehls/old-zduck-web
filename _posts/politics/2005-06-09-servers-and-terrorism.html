title: Servers and Terrorism
---
<p>If you tried to visit the site this afternoon, I apologize for the short outage.  Our hosting company, ServerBeach, had a power loss for about 4 hours and all of the servers there were down.  At some point I&#8217;ll have to get a backup server that is somewhere else, but for now I just feel bad for the guys working there &#8211; I bet it&#8217;s been a heck of a bad day.</p><br/>

	<p>The big news is the recent <a href="http://www.lodinews.com/articles/2005/06/09/news/1_terror_main_050609.txt">arrest</a> of five Lodi men suspected of terrorism.  Lodi is, of course, one of the cities in our district and this is just shocking to the small community.  For a great overview, please go to the <a href="http://www.lodinews.com">Lodi News-Sentinel</a> website as they are doing a series of reports on different aspects of the story.  For a really scary read, see the <span class="caps">FBI</span> <a href="http://www.lodinews.com/downloads/affidavit.pdf">affidavit</a> (United States v. Hamid Hayat).</p><br/>

	<p>I&#8217;ll keep everyone up to date on this as things unfold and especially as we eventually get out to Lodi to go door to door.</p>
