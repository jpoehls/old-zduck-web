title: School's Out
---
<p>Almost every day this week has been spent with my wife Jessica in her classroom, finishing up the last days of school &#8211; grading, entering scores, cleaning out the classroom.  So, the posts have been sparse.  Now that school is out and our schedules have opened up a little, we&#8217;ll be ramping up our activity again.</p><br/>

	<p>Speaking of Jessica, she just finished a 0.75 mile swim at <a href="http://www.ebparks.org/parks/delval.htm">Lake Del Valle</a> in Livermore.  It was her first competitive swim in quite a while and she did a great job.  I had the honor of marking everyone for the race, so I wrote everyone&#8217;s number on them.  We met a lot of great people there and had a good time, so we&#8217;ll hopefully go to more events in the future.</p><br/>

	<p>In fact, we&#8217;re going to start training for Pleasanton&#8217;s <a href="http://www.onyourmarkevents.com/Event%20Data/Tri%20for%20Fun.html">Tri For Fun</a> triathalon, which is in four weeks, so if you are a local athlete, I hope to see you there.  I&#8217;ll let everyone know how our &#8220;training&#8221; progresses.</p><br/>

	<p>On the campaign front, we&#8217;re getting our research volunteers organized with their topics, so the Issues section of this site should be more filled out by the end of summer.</p><br/>

	<p>I hope all the teachers out there are starting to wind down, and all of the fathers have a happy Father&#8217;s Day.</p><br/>
