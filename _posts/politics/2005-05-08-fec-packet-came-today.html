title: FEC Packet Came Today
---
<p>So, the packet of information that the <span class="caps">FEC</span> sent me got here today.  I was waiting to file my Form 2 (Statement of Candidacy) until it got here, but it looks like there is nothing in it that I didn&#8217;t already have.  Which is actually good.  Everything in the packet is available online, so I sealed up my Form 2 and I&#8217;m sending it off tonight.  Actually, hold on&#8230;</p><br/>

	<p>Ha! Interactive blogging!  I just ran down to the corner and stuck the envelope in the mail.  Here is proof :</p><br/>

	<p>Anyhow, it turns out that the packet contained this :</p><br/>

<ul>
<li>Forms 1 and 2, with instructions, from <a href="http://www.fec.gov/info/forms.shtml">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fec.gov/pdf/candgui.pdf">This guide</a>, printed out.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/treasurers_brochure.pdf">This brochure</a>.</li>
<li>A list of state addresses to get copies of filings.</li>
</ul><br/>

	<p>That&#8217;s all, so not a whole lot of help there, but it was nice of them to spend $3.50 to send it.  If we weren&#8217;t internet savvy, and didn&#8217;t have copies of all of those things on our computer, they would have been a big help.</p><br/>

Also, as the <span class="caps">FEC</span> website says : 
<blockquote>If you don&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for on these pages, please contact the <span class="caps">FEC</span>&#8217;s Information Division, toll free at 800-424-9530 or by e-mail at info@fec.gov. </blockquote><br/>
	<p>So, there you go.  It&#8217;s done &#8211; I&#8217;ll post my <span class="caps">FEC</span> Number as soon as I get it.</p>
