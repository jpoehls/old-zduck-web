<p>I recorded this morning, yet I didn&#8217;t actually post until tonight.  However, as it is 10:45pm and I am off to bed, I&#8217;ll just post the file without a whole lot of blab here.  It&#8217;s mostly about the <span class="caps">PDF</span> conference, which you can read about below anyhow.</p><br/>

	<p>Oh, and I also mentioned <a href="http://www.chicagocrime.org">ChicagoCrime.org</a>, which is a pretty neat idea and application of technology to bring powerful information to citizens.  Let me know what you think about that, and any ideas you might have to bring powerful information to our communities like that.</p><br/>

	<p>Don&#8217;t forget to call in with comments at <b>206-20-CHACON</b></p><br/>
