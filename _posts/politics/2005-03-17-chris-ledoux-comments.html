<p>I wanted to copy the comments I made on the <a href="http://www.dogfight04.com/dogfight04/2005/03/tribute_to_a_no.html">Political Dogfight post</a> of the passing of Chris LeDoux here:</p><br/>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s terrible to hear. I had no idea that Chris had died. My wife and I have been Chris LeDoux fans for many years, in fact one of our first dates was at a Chris LeDoux concert at the Ventura Fairgrounds &#8211; every time I hear &#8216;County Fair&#8217;, I think of that. We saw him in concert the week before we got married, and his &#8220;Two in a Million&#8221; was our wedding song.</p><br/>

	<p>Every time I hear &#8220;Western Skies&#8221;, I am reminded of our honeymoon in Montana, and &#8220;Song of Wyoming&#8221; brings up images of our vacation backpacking in the Tetons. His music is the spirit of the American West to me, and I am incredibly sorry to hear of his passing.
I&#8217;ve been to many of the concerts he did here in California, from one in Moorpark all the way up to a few Mid-State fairs when he played on the free stages. I remember when his drummer took off for a while and his kid filled in for a few months, and then his drummer came back and they had two drums going at the same time on stage. I even remember when he had that surgery and then started touring again, but he had to stop riding the bull at the end of his show. I remember him saying how long he&#8217;d been married to his wife, and how much he still loved her after all these years, before singing &#8220;Gravitaional Pull&#8221; every time.</p><br/>

	<p>I remember his energy, his enthusiasm and his wonderful music. In the current pop country music world of the likes of Rascal Flatts and &#8220;She Thinks My Tractor&#8217;s Sexy&#8221;, Chris&#8217;s music always reminds me why I liked country music to begin with. It is about cowboys, rodeo, friendship, love and freedom. I guess I&#8217;ll just put on &#8220;Melodies and Memories&#8221; from my old box set and say a little &#8216;goodbye&#8217; to a real American artist.&#8221;</p><br/>
