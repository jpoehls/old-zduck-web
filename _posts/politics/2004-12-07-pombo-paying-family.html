title: Pombo Paying Family
---
<p>So I found out today that I could have been a reporter.  About a month ago I was looking at <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.asp?CID=N00007516&#38;cycle=2004">Pombo&#8217;s finances</a> at <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org">OpenSecrets</a>.  I was looking for contribution amounts, but I wandered into expenditure amounts. I found that when you sort by amount spent, the places Pombo spent the most money wasn&#8217;t media consulting, as I expected, but members of his own family. Then, I saw that some lines were &#8220;Pombo, Annette&#8221; and others were &#8220;Annette Pombo&#8221;, so the real amounts were even higher &#8211; you had to add more than one line item.  I told my wife, but I assumed this was just how the system worked &#8211; it turns out that I&#8217;m a better investigative reporter than I thought.</p><br/>

	<p>From the <a href="http://www.recordnet.com/articlelink/120504/news/articles/120504-gn-2.php">Stockton Record</a> this weekend :</p><br/>

<blockquote>Federal records show that Rep. Richard Pombo used campaign funds to pay his wife and brother a total of $255,916 over the past two years&#8212;or 25 cents for every dollar the Tracy Republican raised for his re-election effort.<br/>
	<p>Reports filed with the Federal Election Commission also show Pombo&#8217;s campaign paid the congressman&#8217;s wife, Annette, an additional $39,938 from 2001 to 2002. His brother Randall received $169,299 during the same period, bringing the total payments to the family since 2001 to $465,153.</blockquote></p><br/>

	<p>Although a few other representatives do pay their family members for staff work, no one else even comes close to these amounts.  This isn&#8217;t really outright illegal, as far as I know, but what does it say about his character?  I just wouldn&#8217;t want to be someone who gave $100 because I believed in his campaign, only to learn that $25 of my money went to his brothers or wives personal bank accounts.  To think of it another way, Pombo gets 55% of his money from PACs, which means that special interests are almost directly paying his wife $50,000 per cycle for &#8220;clerical&#8221; work.  In the interest of fairness, maybe there is a good reason for it, and if I hear one, I&#8217;ll post it.</p><br/>

	<p>If you want to see the numbers for yourself, <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/expend.asp?CID=N00007516&#38;cycle=2004&#38;Sort=A">please do</a>.</p><br/>
