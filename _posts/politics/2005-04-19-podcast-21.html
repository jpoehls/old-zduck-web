<p>A long weekend of campaign preparation behind us, Jessica and I are taking a day each off of work to be home for contractors fixing things in our kitchen.  It was supposed to have been fixed when we moved in, but a year later is fine too.</p><br/>

	<p>This podcast is all about my campaign journal &#8211; what we have been working on, materials we have finished, etc.  I also talk a little bit about data processing for the targeting process, so I can tell you, it&#8217;s all about excitement.</p><br/>

	<p>I want to start writing more in the blog, and I think I&#8217;m going to do a &#8216;campaign journal&#8217; category here, for those of you who are curious but don&#8217;t listen to the podcast.  You can find a lot of it in the shownotes, but it&#8217;s pretty impersonal.  I&#8217;ll try to put some effort into that.  I really want to document as much of this as possible, I&#8217;m just not the natural writer that some bloggers are.  I will work on it.</p><br/>

	<p>Don&#8217;t forget to call in with comments at <b>206-20-CHACON</b></p><br/>
