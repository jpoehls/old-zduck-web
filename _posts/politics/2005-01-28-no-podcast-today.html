title: No Podcast Today
---
<p>Sorry, but there is no podcast today, even though I said there would be.  I had all the stuff ready, I pressed record and a few seconds later the recorder ran out of batteries.  I did not have enough time before work to get new ones so it will have to wait until Monday.   Until then, I do have a new voice message line that you can leave me voice messages on so I can play them on my show.  I will mention it in the actual podcast, but if you want to leave a message for me this weekend, the number is :</p><br/>

	<p>(915) 808-2925</p><br/>

	<p>&lt;!<del>- more -</del>&gt;</p><br/>

	<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a Texas area code, and I can&#8217;t customize the outbound message, but its free thanks to <a href="http://www.j2.com">j2.com</a>.  I hope to hear from you.  If the line becomes more popular, I&#8217;ll upgrade to the fancy-pants version.</p>
