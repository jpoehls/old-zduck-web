title: Site Update and Ashdown
---
Sorry about the downtime â€“ this site has had some issues over the last few days.  I was using a bleeding edge version of Typo and a memory leak kept killing the server.  We'll see if this stable version can stay up for a while.<br/>
On another note, I have been watching <a href="http://vote.peteashdown.com">Pete Ashdown's</a> run for Senate in Utah â€“ give it a look, as I'm sure it will be a new front in Open Source politics.
