<p>I was mentioned briefly in a San Francisco Chronicle <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/02/28/BUGJUBGR591.DTL"> article</a> today, which was on the topic of podcasting :</p><br/>

<blockquote>Scott Chacon, 25, a Democrat from Dublin who plans to run for Congress in 2006, hopes to use the new medium to reach far-flung voters in California&#8217;s 11th Congressional District, which includes parts of Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara and San Joaquin counties.</blockquote><br/>
	<p>Just to clarify, you don&#8217;t need to be far-flung to listen.</p><br/>

	<p>It&#8217;s not much, but it&#8217;s a start.  I spoke for a while with the writer, Benny, and I mentioned it briefly in one of my podcasts.  He had mentioned that the Chronicle was considering doing a podcast of it&#8217;s own, and I think the reference to the Ventura County Star comes from information I told him as well.</p><br/>

	<p>On another note, I did a lot of work on the website this weekend.  It is still on my laptop, but it will be live here in the next few days.  I can&#8217;t wait to hear feedback on it.</p><br/>
