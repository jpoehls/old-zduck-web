<p>OK, it&#8217;s fixed.  Podcast number 4, the hits just keep on coming!  Notice that I now have a podcast icon at the end of the sidebar there on the left.  If  you need to know how to subscribe to the show, see yesterdays post on how to &#8220;podcatch&#8221;.  How does everybody like the new site design?</p><br/>

	<p>Until friday, everybody enjoy the State of the Union!</p><br/>
