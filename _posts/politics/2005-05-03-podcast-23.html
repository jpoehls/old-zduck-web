<p>Good morning everyone!</p><br/>

	<p>This week I found a couple of useful websites I would like to mention to everyone :</p><br/>

	<p><a href="http://www.conversate.org">conversate.org</a> just launched today or yesterday, I think.  It&#8217;s a site to have short conversations with several people &#8211; kind of like an instant blog, but more concentrated on the comments section.</p><br/>

	<p><a href="http://www.backpackit.com">Backpack</a> launched today, about 5 minutes ago.  I had a Golden Ticket, so I have used it for a couple of days already, and I think it&#8217;s pretty neat.  If you have a hard time keeping your thoughts and notes organized across computers, check it out.  It is as clean and simple and easy to use as their excellent <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> application.</p><br/>

	<p>Also, the <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> site is one I just found.  I had heard about it before, but I actually used it last night, and it&#8217;s pretty easy to use.  Please go there and check your credit reports and challenge anything that doesn&#8217;t look familiar.  You get a free credit report every 12 months.</p><br/>

	<p>I changed the front page of my website here around a little bit &#8211; added a picture of us (where my clothing matches the site colors) and cleaned up some of the styles a bit.  What do you think?</p><br/>

	<p>Lastly, the big news is that I was invited to go to the <a href="http://www.personaldemocracy.com">Personal Democracy Forum</a> conference in New York on May 16 for free.  I am really interested in this conference and the ideas of many of the people speaking there.  I&#8217;ll keep everyone up to date on what I see and do there.  I&#8217;ll even see if I can get some podcasts going.  Also, if you&#8217;re interested, they offered my readers a $100 discount on the registration fee.  Just go to their website to register and enter the promo code &#8216;<b>pdfc195</b>&#8217;.</p><br/>

<blockquote>The Personal Democracy Forum Conference boasts a comprehensive roster of speakers including Meetup.com&#8217;s Scott Heiferman, <span class="caps">SEIU</span>&#8217;s Andy Stern, The <span class="caps">RNC</span>&#8217;s Michael Turk, Technorati&#8217;s David Sifry, Linux Journal&#8217;s Doc Searls, Grassroots Media&#8217;s Dan Gillmor, Craigslist&#8217;s Craig Newmark, bloggers Jeff Jarvis, Josh Marshall, Markos Moulitsas and Chris Nolan, and many more!</blockquote><br/>
