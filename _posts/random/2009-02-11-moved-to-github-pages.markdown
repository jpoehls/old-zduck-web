title: Moved my blog to GitHub Pages
---

It's been a while since I made a big blogging change - I've been on Wordpress
for a pretty long time now and have generally liked it, but the theme wasn't 
so hot and the general zeitgiest of my postings have veered much more into
programming than politics over the last year or so.  So, I thought it might
be time for a change.

As of this post, my blogging software of choice is 
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master) and my new hosting
provider is [GitHub Pages](http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages).  Which 
is pretty cool for me, since I am part of the small team here at GitHub.

In the past, I have had two catastrophic data losses from my hosting providers
losing a good number of my posts.  Each time I thought I would finally remember
to setup something that would back them up, but I never did.  Now I finally 
have a secure backup for my blog data, since everything is done via a 
[Git](http://git-scm.com) repository.  How it works is I keep the source for
my blog in a specially named GitHub repository and every time I push to it, 
GitHub pixies automagically generate my static blog pages for me.

So, now my blog and content are all available via a public 
[Git repository](http://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com),
if you're interested in using it for anything.  I copied the theme and javascript
from [Michael Bleigh](http://github.com/mbleigh), and you're welcome to copy
it from me, in turn (do remember to credit Michael, though).

I do love GitHub.
