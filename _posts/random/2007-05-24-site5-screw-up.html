title: Site5 Screw Up
---
Sorry about the complete loss of all my posts for the previous year or so, but Site5 just went down and lost everything I had.Â  I have the last 10 cached, so I'll re-add those, but everything from Jan - April is pretty much gone.Â  Second time, second host in a year.Â  Fantastic.Â  And I still haven't learned to back anything up.
