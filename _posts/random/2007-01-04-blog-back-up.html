title: Blog Back Up
---
<p>My hosting provider, Planet Argon, had a major, major screwup this past week.  Their server that was running this blog got hosed and they apparently had no backups or anything, so it not only took days to get back up and running, but I&#8217;m missing the last few months worth of blog posts.  I have backups, but it&#8217;s going to take me a while to get them all imported again.  I apologize &#8211; I&#8217;m thinking of moving the blog to Vox or possibly just another hosting provider, but I haven&#8217;t made up my mind yet.</p>
