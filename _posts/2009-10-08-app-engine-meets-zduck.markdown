And... we're back.

I apologize if you are subscribed to my feed and are seeing old posts
show up. The thing is, I've completely overhauled my blog.

If you only read the feed, check out the site in full color at [www.zduck.com](http://www.zduck.com).
I'd love to know what you think.

The site is now running on Google AppEngine, however it is mostly
static HTML generated by Jekyll (of [Github fame](http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages)).

Being a C# guy I had to stretch my brain some in the process. After
all, <acronym title="Google App Engine">GAE</acronym> is running [Python](http://www.python.org/)
and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

To add to the stack of foreign languages, I'm using [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to
version control the site and blog posts.

I'll be blogging soon about some of the experiences I've had with all this
new stuff, so stay tuned!
