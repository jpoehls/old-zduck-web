> Every hard disk is too small if you just wait long enough.
> TreeSize Free tells you where precious space has gone to.
>
> TreeSize Free can be started from the context menu of a folder or drive
> and shows you the size of this folder, including its subfolders.
>
> You can expand this folder in Explorer-like style and you will see the size
> of every subfolder. Scanning is done in a thread, so you can already see
> results while TreeSize Free is working. The space, which is wasted by the
> file system, can be displayed and the results can be printed in a report.

> TreeSize Free is freeware for Windows 9x/2000/XP/Vista.
