This is a simple shameless outburst of joy for my new car... like it?

Meet the <a href="http://www.hyundaiusa.com/vehicle/tiburon/trim/se.aspx">2007 Hyundai Tiburon SE</a>. I haven't even had it for 24 hrs yet but I've put over 100 miles on it and I couldn't be more pleased. Handles GREAT! Has good acceleration (if you don't stall, doh!) and is overall just a blast to drive and ride in. The only complaint I've got is the stock sound system on the SE is pretty lame but that's an easy upgrade later and I never expected it to be great anyway.

This is my first standard transmission car so I'm having a blast squealing, stalling, stuttering and overall being a real <i>jerk</i> of a driver. =P ... I'll have to enjoy that while it lasts cause I know I'll be a wiz at it before I know it.

And for those who care, Yes, I still have my Camaro and although it can't compare performance-wise with the Tiburon, it's still an awesome car (much better than those pony expresses out there :P) and I plan on fixing it up in the future. Hobby time!
