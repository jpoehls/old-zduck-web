<p class="note_content clearfix">Yesterday my wife got a letter from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum that let her know that she was choosen for the USHMM <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=2337068764&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ushmm.org%2Feducation%2Fforeducators%2Fprodev%2Fmandel%2F&amp;h=a416239a5169a7818f8b2149736e76f9" target="_blank" title="http://www.ushmm.org/education/foreducators/prodev/mandel/">Museum Teacher Fellowship Program</a>.<br/>
I'm very proud of her - she's worked hard on a lot of Holocaust and genocide studies programs, many of which have been on her own time and expense, and I think she'll be able to learn a lot from this program.Â  Yay Jessie!
