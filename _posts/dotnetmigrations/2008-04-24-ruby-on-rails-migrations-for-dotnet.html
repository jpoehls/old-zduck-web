<p>I've been looking a lot at Ruby on Rails lately, and one of the things that really stands out to me are the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UnderstandingMigrations">migrations</a>. Migrations is the Rails way of defining your database schema in such a way that it is easy to:
</p><ul><li>put into source control</li><li>shared between developers
</li><li>rollback or upgrade to any version of the schema from any version
</li></ul><p>Plenty of info is available about migrations on at the Ruby on Rails website so I won't duplicate that here. I do recommend reading the basics on <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UnderstandingMigrations">how RoR migrations work</a> before continuing.</p>Suffice to say I wanted something like this to use with my .NET applications pretty bad. I searched around and couldn’t find anything like this for .NET (without jumping into some full blown OR/M) so I made one myself.

<p>I call it "DotNetMigrations" and it's as close to the RoR version of migrations as I could make it. The biggest difference is that your migration script is real T-SQL instead of Ruby. This is actually a big plus in the .NET/SQL Server world since you can just open your script in SQL Management Studio to test it, and copy/paste the scripts Studio generates for you to create your migration scripts.</p>Here's a screenshot from the app with basic usage examples:

<blockquote>README

-------------------

Run db.exe to see usage information.

All migration scripts are stored underneath the current working directory in: /migrate/


Connection strings to your database can be stored in the db.exe.config file.
Connection strings in this file can be referenced by name when executing commands on db.exe.

A [dbo].[schema_info] table will be created inside the database. This table is used to store the current schema version and will be updated whenever you run the 'migrate' command.</blockquote>
Of course everything the application does is wrapped in transactions so if at any point during a migration an error occurs (i.e. some goof-ball screwed up the migration script) it will roll back to the original version of the database.

<p>Since your migration script is just T-SQL you can do anything from create tables and add columns to doing data transformations. And assuming your scripts are well written, =P,  you'll be able to transform your database to/from any version of the schema at anytime.</p>I'm considering creating a Google Code project for this if there's enough interest. Thoughts?
