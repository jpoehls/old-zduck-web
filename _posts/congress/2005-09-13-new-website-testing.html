title: New Website Testing
---
I just put up the code for the new website.  We are still debugging it and adding a few features, but in the interest of the Open Source campaign, I invite you to <a href="http://beta.chaconcorps.com">check it out</a>.<br/>
It may be up and down occasionally as we tweak the server and add the remaining features and data, but it's essentially working and I welcome any feedback you have.  There is also a problem with slowness when clicking on certain specific links, but that's being fixed soon.<br/>
The site is being tested at <a href="http://beta.chaconcorps.com">http://beta.chaconcorps.com</a>, and will replace this website within the next few days, most likely.<br/>
It is also open sourced as a software project, which means you can download the source code for the whole site <a href="http://groundworks.chaconcorps.com">here</a>.  A warning : it is not a product â€“ it is just my website code and would be a bit of work to make it work for someone else, but it's out there nonetheless.  It is written in <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a>, for those of you out there who care.<br/>
Let's hear that <a href="mailto:scott@jointheconversation.org">feedback</a>!
