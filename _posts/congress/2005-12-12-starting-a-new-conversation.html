title: Starting a New Conversation
---
As I mentioned on my Congressional website, I am turning jointheconversation.org into my personal blog again.  This time, I will be concentrating on campaigns and efforts across the country that further Open Source Politics or government.<br/>
I have imported all the articles I had from the Chacon for Congress race (which goes back about a year) and I will try to get the comments imported a bit later.  I will also try to archive a lot of the work of the Chacon for Congress race here for reference.<br/>
I think Open Source and Participatory Politics is the future of governance and I'm looking forward to getting started on our next leg of this journey.<br/>
