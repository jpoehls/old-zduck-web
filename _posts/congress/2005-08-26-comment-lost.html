Yesterday I got a comment from someone sent through the website that for some reason got marked spam and I accidentally deleted it.  It was one of those computer things where you see that you don't want to delete it right as you're clicking the â€œDelete Foreverâ€ button.  So, if you sent me a comment and I haven't gotten back to you, please resend it.<br/>
In other, not entirely related news, I just noticed that Pombo is trying to change his image.  Where before the image of him on his House website featured a rather old picture of him with a cowboy hat, now it has been replaced with â€œslick politicianâ€ Pombo.<br/>

I'm really a little dissapointed. I honestly liked the cowboy hat thing â€“ apparently he used to wear it on the House floor all the time too, but now has stopped that as well.
