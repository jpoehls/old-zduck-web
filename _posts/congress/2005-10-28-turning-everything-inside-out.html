title: Turning Everything Inside-Out
---
Our campaign just got a <a href="http://www.politicsandtechnology.com/2005/10/scott_chacon_fo.html">nice mention</a> on the <a href="http://www.politicsandtechnology.com">Politics and Technology Blog</a>.
<blockquote cite="http://www.politicsandtechnology.com/2005/10/scott_chacon_fo.html"> The typical approach for such a tough race is to raise buckets of money from big-money donors, unleash an attack ad blitz, and spend every waking moment stumping across the district.<br/>

Well, Scott Chacon is anything but typical. He's a software developer running for Congress â€“ and he's using his campaign as the testbed for an open source project to create a new kind of campaign management software. He's also doing just about everything differently.</blockquote>
He mentions the <a href="http://groundworks.chaconcorps.com">GroundWorks</a> software we're developing, as well as giving a good, simple overview of the campaign and how it's different.
<blockquote> It's a new way of thinking about campaigns. Inside-out, really. Check it out.</blockquote>
