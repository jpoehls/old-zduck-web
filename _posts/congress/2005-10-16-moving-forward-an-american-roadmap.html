title: Moving Forward - An American Roadmap
---
I just put up an outline for a simple, long term vision for America and American politics.  It is called â€œ<a href="/pages/myvision">Moving Forward â€“ An American Roadmap</a>â€, and lays out some very simple goals that I think we should pursue as an American nation.
<ul>
	<li>Universal College Education</li>
	<li>Participatory Democracy</li>
	<li>Balanced Budget</li>
	<li>Sustainable Energy Economy</li>
	<li>Wireless America</li>
</ul>
I will be addressing each of these goals in more depth as blog entries in the coming months and linking to those entries from the page.  This is my vision for moving America forward and I look forward to hearing feedback on it.<br/>
