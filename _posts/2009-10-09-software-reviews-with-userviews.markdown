> **"Your one-stop shop for software reviews from everyday users."**

That's the slogan of the recently launched project, [UserViews](http://www.userviews.net).

The site offers a clean, independent atmosphere to search for opinions and reviews 
on software you're interested in and offers a couple of quick ways
to share your opinion of software that you use.

I love how it integrates conversations on
twitter related to the applications. This is great because when I'm 
checking out the reputation of some utility or game, I'll get to see
what people are saying about it on twitter as well as the reviews
that have been posted on UserViews.

So how about you reader? Are reviews on software something you care about?

As with most sites, content will make or break it and user submitted
reviews are the name of the game here. So what ideas
can **you** come up with for gathering feedback from users
and aggregating them on UserViews?
