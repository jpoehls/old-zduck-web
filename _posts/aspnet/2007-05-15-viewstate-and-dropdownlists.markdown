Did you know ViewState is the root of all evil?
Ok, maybe not all evil but certainly 90% of all ASP.NET page bloat.
This isn't a strike against .NET, just a sign of how powerful it really is.
Any platform that can enable developers to screw up so easily and never realize
it has to be very powerful indeed.
To borrow a quote from another blog I was reading...

## Background

Yesterday I wanted to disable ViewState on one of my DropDownLists.
Reason? The drop-down has 3000 items in it.
Yes, I know, sick and wrong... It's bad enough that the drop-down itself is so large
but with ViewState, every item in the drop-down essentially gets sent to the client
***twice!*** How else do you think ViewState remembers what items were in your drop-down when
you do a PostBack? It's very handy, but for large lists it can significantly increase
the size of the page you are sending to the client. Just to give you some idea,
by disabling ViewState on my drop-down I saved nearly 200 kB. That's significant
bandwidth savings, especially for those last couple of dial-up users out there.

## Problem

Now that ViewState is disabled for my drop-down I have a few issues:

1. ASP.NET pulls the SelectedValue property of the DropDownList out of ViewState.
   Guess what? No ViewState == no SelectedValue.
2. Even though AutoPostBack still works, the SelectedIndexChanged event has lost
   its firing pin.
3. My drop-down now loses all of its items after I any post-back occurs.
   Suprise, it also forgets which items was selected.

## Solution

- Despite ASP.NET's attempts to deceive you into thinking that everything that matters
  *must* be a Property of the control (i.e. SelectedValue)...
  ASP.NET is just a fancy wrapper around HTTP and thus any values
  that are set from the client are received by the server via the Request.Form or
  Request.QueryString. Since these are POST-backs, we're interested in Request.Form.
  Now we just need to know that ASP.NET uses the control's UniqueID property to name
  the control on the client, this means that `Request.Form[myDropDownCtrl.UniqueID]`
  will give me the value of that drop-down list as it was sent from the client. This
  is the exact same as `myDropDownCtrl.SelectedValue`. Bingo!
- There are ways to get the SelectedIndexChanged event to fire again but I found an
  easier work-around for my needs. This also covers #3...
