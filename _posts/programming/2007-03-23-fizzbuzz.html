<p class="note_content clearfix">So, this is pretty geeky, but I found it amusing.Â  My friend read <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=2322353764&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.codinghorror.com%2Fblog%2Farchives%2F000781.html&amp;h=6c16c22f0310b3152afa64a0a8336bf1" target="_blank" title="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html">this article</a> which states that most computer programming candidates cannot actually program.Â  So, as is obviously neccesary when a blog article slaps you with a virtual glove, we each worked out our own little solution to the problem that was presented as an example of what candidates could typically not do:</p><br/>
<p class="note_content clearfix">
<blockquote> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print â€œFizzâ€ instead of the number and for the multiples of five print â€œBuzzâ€. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print â€œFizzBuzzâ€.</blockquote>
<blockquote> Most good programmers should be able to write out on paper a program which does this in a under a couple of minutes. Want to know something scary? <strong>The majority of comp sci graduates can't. I've also seen self-proclaimed senior programmers take more than 10-15 minutes to write a solution.</strong></blockquote>
So, this went back and forth a few times between us, escalating.Â  This morning, I emailed him this:<br/>

Turns out it actually runs faster than a one-liner in several situations because it only prints to STDOUT once rather than for every number.<br/>
Ahh, what are pointless fixations if not fun?
