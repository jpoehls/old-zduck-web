title: Why Spambots, Why?
---
I mean, it's not like this is a hugely popular blog, but I must get 20 spam comments a day, most with links to either poker or xanax/viagra/etc.  How is this helping them?  I can't imagine people are coming to my blog and then thinking â€œif only I knew where to get some xanax right nowâ€¦â€<br/>
Anyhow, now I have to up my spambot protections, in an unending geek war of  attrition.  How do these people sleep at night?  What do they tell people they do for a living?
