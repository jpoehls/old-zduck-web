title: Worlds Smallest Rails Contributor
---
<em>(warning, the following blog post is exceedingly geeky...)</em><br/>
This is about the smallest thing I could have possibly done, but I am now a  Ruby on Rails contributor.<br/>
I found a bug with Rails <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Calculations/ClassMethods.html">Calculations</a>
where I was trying to do this :<br/>
<code>
@object.linking_tables.count(:conditions =&gt; ['fieldname = ?', 1])
</code><br/>
and it was failing with malformed SQL.  Apparently, in 1.1, it is only designed to do stuff like this :<br/>
<code>
ObjectClass.count(:conditions =&gt; ['fieldname = ?', 1])
</code><br/>
Which may not look that different, but it really loses a lot of power - the instantiated object and the association are both scope limiters on the query.<br/>
So, I thought I'd be all cool and make the former work - so I setup a patch environment and ran the base AR tests and one broke. I figured out what it was that broke and generated a tiny (tiny) patch and submitted it and it was applied to the trunk a few minutes ago.  So, now I'm the worlds smallest Rails contributor:<br/>

However, I then soon found out that the Calculations have already been modified in the way I was hoping, after I wrote a few tests and they all passed fine.  So, edge Rails works the way I hoped, but I don't get to contribute in a substantial way.  Well, at least I know something that will be in 1.2.  Hopefully next time I can do something more useful.
