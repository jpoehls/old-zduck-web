title: Back from Wyoming
---
Jessica and I just got back from our vacation in the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grte/">Grand Teton National Park</a> in Wyoming.  Here are some of the pictures we took there.<br/>

We were gone from Saturday the 6th to Sunday the 14th.  We drove there, covering over 2590 miles of the American west.<br/>

We backpacked for three days and two nights, hiking over 29 miles on one of the most amazing trails I've ever seen, the Teton Crest trail.<br/>
We covered over 8 miles the first day, 12 the second, and another 8 the third.  If anyone out there backpacks, we would both highly recommend this one.  Hopefully these pictures show some of the beauty.<br/>

Then, when we get back, I read <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/08/17/MNGS8E8RSU1.DTL">this</a> in the paper :
<blockquote> The new evaluation by the Bush administration cuts the estimated value of recreation in national forests from $111 billion to $11 billion, leading some environmentalists to warn that the study could be used to justify increased logging.<br/>
...forestry trade groups and the timber industry hailed the reassessment, saying it more accurately reflects the true value of natural resources to the nation's economy.</blockquote>

We spent much of our time on this hike in national forest area, as the Teton Crest trail goes in and out of park boundaries.  I have to say that after having just lived and breathed this, I find it utterly missing the point to  be putting a price on it at all.  They say they want to be able to have numbers to compare â€œapples to applesâ€, but I don't see that as possible.<br/>
My wife and I just spent three days enjoying the raw beauty of America â€“ saying that was worth $450 to the government is insulting to me and our experience.<br/>
That aside, if you get a chance to go on a vacation like this, consider hiking in the Tetons rather than it's big cousin, Yellowstone. I promise it is worth it.  It is far more amazing than these pictures.<br/>

I think that more accurately reflects the true value of these natural resources than a dollar figure, what do you think?
