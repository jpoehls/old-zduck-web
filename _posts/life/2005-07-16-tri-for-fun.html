title: Tri For Fun
---
I just got back from the Pleasanton <a href="http://www.onyourmarkevents.com/Event%20Data/Tri%20for%20Fun.html">Tri-For-Fun Triathalon</a>.  It is a 400 yard swim, 11 mile bike and 3.1 mile (5K) run.  Wow â€“ for someone who a) hasn't done a triathalon in probably 8 years, and b) hasn't swum (swimmed? swam? â€“ probably swamâ€¦) 1 yard in several months, I was doing pretty well, I thought.<br/>
This is how much thought I put into this race â€“ I got interested around the time Jessica did her lake swim â€“ it seemed like fun.  I was actually both a distance swimmer and cross country runner in high school (though that is about the last time I have done either of those distances), and I guess most Triathaletes don't come from a swim background, which gives me a bit of a lead.  Whereas biking is generally easiest for most â€“ I am much stronger in the other two events.<br/>
Case in point â€“ I sign up for the Triathalon on Tuesday. Wednesday I realize that I in fact have no bike.  I don't even have a mountain bike.  I came to this realization oddly while training on the stationary bike in the gym, and thinking that I can't actually compete on one of those.  So, Friday (yesterday â€“ the day before the actual race), I walk into the <a href="http://www.dublincyclery.com/">Dublin Cyclery</a> Bike Shop, to purchase a bike.  Which, by the way â€“ is just a great shop.  Everyone was really friendly and helpful and the guy didn't even look at me oddly when I told him what I needed the bike for.  No â€œperhaps you should have owned a bike before you registered for the raceâ€ looks anywhere to be found.<br/>
So, for the guy who has now owned a bike (and I don't mean <em>this</em> bike, I mean <em>a</em> bikeâ€¦) for less than 24 hours, who figured out how to shift gears last night before he went to bed, I can't tell you what a thrill it was, and how thoroughly prepared I was for it, when the front tire of my bike went flat about 9 miles into the 11 mile bike leg.  Also, how much fun it is to walk a bike back to the finish line.  Luckily, I didn't have to walk all 2-3 miles, since the course was designed so I was at the opposite side of the park and could just cut through it.  So, my time doesn't really count.  However, I did end up coming in behind people I had been riding with (as I passed several of them on the run), so if anything, my time is probably a little slower than I might have had  (Though, not everyone else had a nice leisurely walk to rest up a bit in the middle).  At any rate, it was good fun, good exercise, and a time to beat in the August one.  After I learn how to fix a bike.<br/>
If the pictures aren't too embarrassing, I might post some later.<br/>
