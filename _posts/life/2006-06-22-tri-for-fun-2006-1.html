title: Tri For Fun 2006 #1
---
Here we are, back into the Tri For Fun series of Pleasanton Sprint Triathlons.  I did it last weekend, and this time Jessica did it too!<br/>

I actually made it all the way through this time without a bike dying on me, but unfortunately, Jessica did not.  Her bike tire went flat a few miles into the ride and she had to turn back and do the run.<br/>
For those of you interested, here are my results (there are no rankings â€“ I don't think they post them for this event) :
<table class="results" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr class="title">
<th></th>
<th>Distance</th>
<th>Rank</th>
<th>Pctile</th>
<th>Time</th>
<th>Pace</th>
</tr>
</table>
I'm not sure what the next Tri will be, as I think Jessica and I will both be gone for the next Tri for Fun.
