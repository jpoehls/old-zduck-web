Wow, you ignore your blog for a while and what do you get?  100 spam comments on one post.  Man.<br/>
Well, it has been a while now since I've been posting here, but I'll try to get it up to speed again â€“ there is a lot going on.  I was trying to get another site launched â€“ a fun project I've been working on with Margee Ensign, interviewing people around Stockton about issues and social solutions there.  However, my video editing skills aren't what I had hoped and it's just taking forever to get them turned out.  The more I put off posting here about it, the more I didn't want to post anything else and alas, the site got ignored.<br/>
The new project <em>will</em> be called <a href="http://DemocracyStoryProject.com">DemocracyStoryProject.com</a>, but there is just a holding page there right now.  Soon though â€“ I have enough raw footage to get a couple stories up.  Maybe I'll start putting some of them here as I'm doing them.<br/>
As for other things, I have been busy.  I have been working with the <a href="http://precinctcaptains.org">Grassroots Champion Coalition</a> on their California Precinct Captains program.  I'm trying to help out with some programming, but the Advokit codebase isâ€¦ well, let's just say <em>special</em> for right now.  The program is great and the people involved are the best, it's just the software that needs a little work.  Or, you know, complete rewrite.  However, I am a Captain now, so if you live in my precinct and you're a Dem, watch out because I'm coming to meet you.<br/>
I'm also trying to stay involved in the Congressional race, and being a Captain I am also trying to stay basically neutral until the mid-terms.  I've spoken with both major campaigns (Thomas didn't respond to my request) and it's certainly interesting.  I am not endorsing either candidate, though the <a href="http://jerrymcnerney.com">McNerney</a> team has been kind enough to ask my advice on a number of things, so I am doing some volunteer work for them.  Maybe I'll post more on that later.<br/>
I have also been contacted by Mark Warner's <a href="http://forwardtogetherpac.com">ForwardTogether <span class="caps">PAC</span></a> web team about what they are trying to do with technology, and I am very impressed.  I would recommend checking out their site and I'm sure I will write much more about them and my involvement with them in the coming months.<br/>
Lastly, I have recently been invited to a Communications Symposium on the <span class="caps">UOP</span> Campus on April 20th, where I'll be on the Professional Panel, which should be fun and/or interesting.  I'll try to get some pictures or video or something to post here.<br/>
On a non-political front, I just competed in my first Triathalon of the season a few weeks ago in Oxnard (near where I grew up) in the <a href="http://strawberryfieldstri.com">Strawberry Fields Tri</a>.  It was great, nice and short, and fun to be back in my home town for it.  For those keeping score, it was a 400yd swim (which was cancelled due to the waters being too dangerous, so we high-kneed it through 200yds of water â€“ ouch), then an 11mi bike and 5k run.  Much fun.<br/>
Well, that's all for now â€“ I'll try to be a bit more regular with these from now on.
