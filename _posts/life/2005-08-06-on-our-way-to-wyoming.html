title: On Our Way to Wyoming
---
We're almost ready to launch the new site and much more, but first Jessica and I are taking a short vacation.  We're just right now finishing packing to go on a short trip to Wyoming to visit my sister who just moved out to Utah, and spend some backpacking time in Grand Teton National Park.  We'll be back next Sunday, and I'll tell you all about it.<br/>
