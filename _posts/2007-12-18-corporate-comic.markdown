This is my first comic strip, inspired by a random spurt of creativity.
I can't take all the credit though. The fantastic 'lettering' was done
by a very good friend ;)

If you can't make it out, here's a blow-by-blow description...

The comic depicts an inspector looking at a tank that is structurally insecure.
During his inspection, the tank falls on him and begins to roll down the hill,
snowballing with the inspector on it.
