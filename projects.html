<p>
    What do I work on when I'm not at work? My own projects of course!<br />
</p>
<div class="project">
    <h3>
        BenjiBender</h3>
    <span class="status_active">IN PROGRESS</span>
    <p>
        I haven't prepared a press release for this one yet. When things get further down
        the road I'll let you know.

<div class="project">
    <h3>
        ZWord</h3>
    <span class="status_hold">FILE 13</span>
    <p>
        ZWord is a project I started to create a web based Bible Study application. Its
        claim to fame would be a minimalist design focused on usability and the ability
        for users to highlight scriptures and enter personal study notes that are stored
        online and could be optionally shared with others.
    </p>

        This project has been on hold for several years and I'm not sure if it'll get picked
        back up again or not.
